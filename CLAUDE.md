# The E4 Mafia Network — project context

Read this first in any session touching this repo. The global rules in
`/root/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (and `/root/.claude/exam-prep-coach.md`) apply
here and win over anything below.

**Live site:** https://rafikiscyent888.github.io/The-E4-Mafia-Network/
**Status (9 October 2026):** nothing built yet. Decisions are agreed (below);
next is a preview of the home-level workspace and the first ticket, for the
owner's go-ahead before any build.

## What it is

The Network+ (V9) Under the Hood build: an **interactive networking model**,
our own, **not a recreation of Cisco Packet Tracer** (owner, 9 October 2026:
"I dont want to recreate the packet tracer"). Static HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, no
build step, served from `main` by GitHub Pages.

- **Build mode:** students build their own networks: place devices, cable
  them, configure them. Each build has a goal the model checks by sending
  real traffic through what they built.
- **Troubleshoot mode:** prebuilt networks with a generated fault, proven
  present before a student sees it.
- **Faults:** everything the Network+ objectives list, plus the common
  real-world faults technicians meet, generated so students don't memorise
  them (owner agreed this wording, 9 October 2026).
- **Command line on every device that really has one** (owner: "they need
  to learn the commands and how to move around a network"): routers,
  switches and firewalls get an industry-standard network CLI with our own
  unbranded device names; PCs get Windows Command Prompt; servers get Linux.
  Home routers and access points use a web page, as real ones do.
- **Levels:** home, then small office, small business, campus, enterprise
  (data center, WAN, cloud).

## The owner's decisions, 9 October 2026

1. **Repo:** this one, The-E4-Mafia-Network.
2. **Setting:** Rafiki's IT Services again, with **fresh code**: nothing
   copied from the Core 1 or Core 2 builds.
3. **Commands:** the industry-standard style; students must learn the
   commands and how to move around a network.
4. **3D models:** the owner supplies the photographs, because the models
   must be real-world accurate. The shot list given to the owner is below.
5. **First slice:** the home level: build mode with its goal checker, and
   troubleshooting tickets for the faults that fit a home network, plus the
   standing five extra scenarios. Then climb a level at a time.
6. **Placement:** the Under the Hood Labs tile (repo `under-the-hood-labs`
   and the Command Center's tile), **between A+ Core 2 and Security
   Start-up Firewall**. Add the link only once the first slice is live.

## Built like the real world, as one giant teaching tool

The owner, 10 October 2026: **"I want this to built like you would do in the
real world however as one gaint teaching tool."** So the configuration is
the real job, done with the real commands on each device, and the model
proves the result by sending traffic through it: a VLAN either carries the
traffic or it doesn't, for the real reason. Every configuration skill is
also a troubleshooting skill: what can be configured can be broken in a
ticket, found with the show commands and fixed with the configuration ones.

What students configure, by level (agreed 10 October 2026):

| Level | Configuration |
|---|---|
| **Home** | IP plan (address, mask, gateway, DNS); the router's web page (DHCP range, Wi-Fi name and security, port forwarding); static addresses for a printer or camera |
| **Small office** | First managed switch: hostname, passwords, remote management, port settings (speed, duplex, shutting unused ports); subnetting the office into blocks |
| **Small business** | VLANs (create, access ports, trunks with allowed and native VLANs); inter-VLAN routing on router subinterfaces; a DHCP scope per VLAN; ACLs; NAT/PAT; a guest network kept apart |
| **Campus** | Layer 3 switches with a gateway per VLAN; spanning tree (root bridge, port roles, protections); link aggregation; OSPF; first-hop redundancy with a virtual gateway; MTU and jumbo frames; port security |
| **Enterprise** | BGP to the providers; route selection across static, OSPF and EIGRP; a screened subnet and firewall zones; site-to-site and remote-access VPN; a cloud network (VPC, security groups, cloud gateway); SNMP, syslog, NTP, port mirroring |

**Subnetting is by hand:** students work out classful, CIDR and VLSM plans
themselves and record them in an IPAM sheet; the model catches overlaps,
wrong masks and gateways outside the subnet. No built-in calculator does it
for them, and Mason's hints point at the principle, never the answer.

## More decisions, 10 October 2026

- **Network-Sims is a knowledge base**, as Core-2-Sims was for Core 2: each
  sim becomes a ticket set (the sim itself plus five more), the sims' own
  keys stand, Extra training covers the objectives no sim covers, and an
  Exam Practice view lays each sim out the way the exam does.
- **Both build modes:** client jobs (a work order: rooms, devices,
  requirements, limits such as 100 m runs and the PoE budget, the model
  checks the job against it) as the main path, and free build.
  **Still open:** whether jobs carry an equipment budget.
- **Instructor tools behind PIN 3693:** choose a specific fault for a class
  demonstration, show the fault and the fix after class, unlock any level.
- **Defaults the owner did not object to:** a logical diagram and a
  physical view (house floor plan, closet rack in 3D) plus a terminal
  panel; console-cable setup first, then SSH, web pages for home gear;
  Mason as team lead and coach with the program's ladder and rules; a
  packet step-through showing headers change hop by hop; Wi-Fi shaped by
  walls, distance and neighbours' networks; AAA, a persistent dyslexia
  toggle, the full footer, progress saved in the browser.
- **"Don't build yet"** (owner, 10 October 2026): photographs still coming.

### Photographs received (10 October 2026)

Home level, in the session, not in the repo: a mesh node (front, side,
back with WAN/LAN/12V ports, bottom label, status LED), a cable modem
(front LEDs POWER/DS/US/ONLINE/LINK-ACT; back coax F-type, Ethernet,
reset, power), a fiber ONT (POWER/PON/ALARM/LINK-ACT/ETHERNET; green SC/APC
fiber port, Ethernet, 12V DC), a home wireless router (four antennas;
INTERNET/WAN, LAN 1-4, RESET, WPS, power), a 5-port unmanaged gigabit
switch (front ports with link LEDs, back power). Brand marks in the photos
stay off the models.

Then the rest of the home list, the same day: RJ11 beside RJ45 (two shots),
straight-through (T568B) and crossover (T568A end) connectors, a bad
termination (jacket out, too much untwist), a kinked and crushed cable, a
compression F-type coax connector, a data/voice wall plate (Ethernet and
telephone), a desktop PC rear panel, a laptop's Ethernet side, a network
printer (port with link/activity LEDs, control panel showing its IP), a
smart TV rear panel, a PoE dome IP camera, a cable tester (main and remote,
pins 1-8 and G), and the tools (RJ45/11 crimper, 110 punch-down, tone
generator, inductive probe, RJ45 loopback plug). **The home-level list is
complete.**

Accuracy notes for the models (the photos are reference, the standards
win): wire colour order follows TIA-568 T568A/T568B exactly, not the
photo's pixels; RJ11 is a 6-position connector (2 conductors for one line,
4 for two lines), not "4-pin"; garbled text in the photos (tester screen,
labels) is replaced with correct wording; sides a photo doesn't show follow
the standard design for that device and are previewed before use.

## Objectives

Read from the owner's "All updated Objectives" Google Doc
(`1C9MhVjNyXHJ_i3mPthaBNRmB3A0_sG8UJmzv_H3Lddo`) on 9 October 2026 and shown
to the owner. **Re-read it at the start of every build**: this is a
snapshot. Domains: Networking concepts (23%), Network implementation (20%),
Network operations (19%), Network security (14%), Network troubleshooting
(24%). The doc gives no numbered sub-objectives; invent none.

## Photographs for the 3D models

both sides, top, and close-ups of ports, LEDs (powered on) and the label;
straight-on, plain background, soft light, no flash glare; the make and

and Wi-Fi passwords covered. Brand logos stay off the models.
